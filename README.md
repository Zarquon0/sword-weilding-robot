# sword-weilding-robot
This repository contains a PPO trainer and ROS controller for a sword weilding, 7 DOF robotic arm. The associated Unity side scripts for directly controlling the arm and communicating with this ROS controller can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Zarquon0/swr-unity-scripts">here</a>.

The original end goal of this project was to create an arm skilled enough in the way of the blade to challenge a human in a VR sword duel. While I didn't quite get to that point in the month I had to work on this, I feel I have made significant progress with respect to the guiding motivations behind this project, those being to learn Unity and VR development through it from scratch, gain some more experience with Blender, ROS, PyTorch, and RL, explore robotic control, and create something super cool and fun!

Currently, my best model can fairly reliably hit any training target within its range in under 5 seconds (500 timesteps for the arm, within which each joint can rotate a maximum of 2 degrees in either direction), though it sometimes struggles with targets located far behind or under its starting position. The next steps for this project would be, first, to further clean up the arms ability to hit targets within its stationary range (just randomized the starting position of the arm to this end!), second, to incentivize quick jabs and cuts over just touching the targets, third, to train the arm on moving targets and give it the ability to move itself within the xy plane, and finally, to train it to fight an equivalently armed opponent through repeated battles with itself (or slightly noised versions of itself in an evolutionary approach). Perhaps if time permits in the near future, I'll come back to this and give it a good update!

<strong>AI Usage Note:</strong> Generative AI (Gemini 3 Pro) was used liberally throughout many portions of this project. Given my nonexistent experience with Unity and limited experience with ROS and RL for robotics prior to this project, I simply would not have been able to cover the ground I was able to cover without this usage. As such, much of the code in this repository (and the associated C# Unity-side one), perhaps 70%, was either generated in full by AI or mannually editted from code that was originally AI generated. However, 100% of the code in both repositories has been fully looked over and analyzed by myself, and I am confident that with the aid of the notes I have taken and online documentation, I could reimplement all pieces of this project without the aid of AI. This project was NOT vibecoded! Nonetheless, generative AI played a substantial role in the construction of this project, and I feel I must give credit where it's due in this regard.
